# Stat-Assist Platform


## Overview

Stat-Assist is designed to make clinical research design, analysis, and reporting friction-less for clinicians. The platform guides users through the process of designing studies, selecting appropriate statistical tests, calculating required sample sizes, and generating study protocols.

## Key Features

- **Study Design Wizard**: Step-by-step guidance for designing various study types (RCT, Diagnostic Accuracy, Cohort)
- **Statistical Test Recommender**: Automated recommendations for appropriate statistical tests based on study design and variables
- **Power Calculator**: Interactive sample size and power calculations with visualizations
- **Protocol Generator**: Automated generation of study protocols based on design inputs

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQ
- **Frontend**: React (Next.js), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- aat engine
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes-ready

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/stat-assist.git
   cd stat-assist
   ```

2. Install dependencies for all services:
   ```
   npm run install:all
   ```

   This will install:
   - Python dependencies for the API service
   - Python dependencies for the PowerSim service
   - Node.js dependencies for the UI service

### Running the Application

Start all services with a single command:

```
npm start
```

This will concurrently run:
- Backend API at http://localhost:8000
- Frontend UI at http://localhost:3000
- PowerSim service at http://localhost:8001

### Development

For development, you can run each service individually:

```
# Run only the backend API
npm run start:api

# Run only the frontend UI
npm run start:ui

# Run only the PowerSim service
npm run start:powersim
```

## Demo Access

For demonstration purposes, you can use the "Demo Login" button on the login page. This will give you access to the platform without requiring registration.

## Performance Requirements

- Page load time: ≤2s p95
- API response time: ≤500ms p95
- Power calculations: ≤5s for complex simulations

## Security and Compliance

- PHI isolation with field-level encryption
- Comprehensive audit trail
- Zero-trust security model
- HIPAA and GDPR compliant (under reviewal)

## Accessibility

- WCAG 2.2 AA compliant
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Support for screen readers and keyboard navigation
